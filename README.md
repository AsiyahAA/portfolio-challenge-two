# portfolio-challenge-two
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a portfolio using advanced CSS skills. Using skills like flexbox properties, positioning, media queires, and animations, a portfolio website was to be created following mock portfolio example given in assignment instructions. Using skills learned (semantic tags and proper HMTL coding), and along with new skills learned (advanced CSS), the portfolio website should be creative, engaging, and accessible to all.    
## User
### User should be able to see/hear a functioning website with clear headers and subheaders, navigation links that work and have a hover effect, a backgorund avatar with a subtitle and a description, background images for work projects with a hover effect, work sections when selected or hovered over get bigger in size, an About Me section, a Work section, and a Contact Me section-and section contents-with a clear and organized layout. Content should adapt to screen size and content should rearrange itself once screen gets smaller or bigger.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a repository onto a computer and was used to deploy the website when edits where finished. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML and CSS files and to make edits. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command git clone and copying in the URL, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new HTML file titled index.html and a new CSS folder titled style.css. Start on HTML code and once that is completed, start on your CSS file and view all changes and progress in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.

## Status 
### Unfortunetly, code and website need to be cleaned up of errors. Flexbox properties and media queries are not properly used and layout of website is not reflective of assignment example. Hover effect for background images does not show up on deployed application and content size does not change when screen size is manipulated.
